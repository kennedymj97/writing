# Writing Ideas

**Don't prematurely optimise**
Discuss some of my thoughts on the topic. Don't focus on it from a code point of view, also transfer it to refactoring code, writing and reading. Often it is hard to know what the structure of writing/code should be until after you have got all of the content down. Any attempts to plan in detail the structure is a waste of time and may limit the potential quality of the content. Similarly with reading trying to read a whole book in detail is premature optimisation, you are not going to be able to remember the whole book. It is better to skim through the book and get a rough idea of what it is about and then focus on the areas that you will add value to you. Don't just read it because you feel you should.
