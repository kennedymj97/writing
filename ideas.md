# Writing Ideas

**Don't prematurely optimise**
Discuss some of my thoughts on the topic. Don't focus on it from a code point of view, also transfer it to refactoring code and writing. Often it is hard to know what the structure of writing/code should be until after you have got all of the content down. Any attempts to plan in detail the structure is a waste of time and may limit the potential quality of the content.
